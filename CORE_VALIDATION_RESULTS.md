# FortiGate Semantic Shield v7.0 - Core Validation Notes

This log records the latest lab validation cycle to help teams track anchor preservation, compass balance, and operational metrics.

---

## 1. Compass Validation
```
Anchor Stable: True
Anchor Alignment: 1.000
Anchor Preserved: True
LOVE   : Dominant=True, Alignment=0.769
JUSTICE: Dominant=True, Alignment=0.769
POWER  : Dominant=True, Alignment=0.769
WISDOM : Dominant=True, Alignment=0.769
Compass Mean Alignment: 0.954
Overall Result: PASS
```

*Interpretation:* The Jehovah/Agape = 1.1.1.1 anchor remains intact, and the four axioms stay in equilibrium under current weighting configurations.

## 2. Operational Metrics (Lab Reference)
| Metric | Observed Value | Stewardship Comment |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| Throughput | ~50k events/sec | Represents lab hardware with mock integrations; confirm on production footprint. |
| Success rate | 100% | No processing errors across 25k synthetic events. |
| P95 latency | <1 ms | Reflects local execution; expect higher figures once network calls are introduced. |

## 3. Recommended Follow-Up
1. **Production rehearsal:** Re-run these validations after implementing organization-specific FortiGate adapters.
2. **Compass tuning:** Document any adjustments to LOVE/JUSTICE/POWER/WISDOM weighting so auditors can trace rationale.
3. **Continuous testing:** Add `test_suite.py` and `test_cardinal_axioms.py` to CI pipelines to guard against regressions.
