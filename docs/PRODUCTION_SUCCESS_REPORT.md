# FortiGate Semantic Shield v7.0 - Deployment Progress Report

**Context**  
Summarizes recent lab workstreams and highlights remaining items for organizations preparing to run FortiGate Semantic Shield in supervised production environments.

---

## 1. Highlights From Latest Iteration
- **Semantic pipeline:** Batch and streaming tests processed 25k synthetic events with consistent compass alignment, maintaining equilibrium across LOVE, JUSTICE, POWER, and WISDOM.
- **Throughput headroom:** Async workers sustained >50k events/second in lab scenarios-use these numbers as directional only; confirm with production adapters.
- **Validation coverage:** `CARDINAL_AXIOMS_PRESERVATION_REPORT.md` and `CORE_VALIDATION_RESULTS.md` capture the evidence base reviewed during this cycle.
- **Documentation refresh:** README, quick start, and whitepaper updates now spotlight business outcomes, governance workflows, and open-source collaboration.
- **Intuition tuning:** `fortigate_semantic_shield/ss_intuition.py` now applies golden-ratio batching so lab runs surface LOVE/JUSTICE/POWER/WISDOM trade-offs in real time.

## 2. Items Completed This Cycle
| Workstream | Outcome | Artifacts |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| Compass assurance | Anchor Jehovah/Agape = 1.1.1.1 reaffirmed; L/J/P/W balance verified | `test_cardinal_axioms.py`, `CARDINAL_AXIOMS_PRESERVATION_REPORT.md` |
| Business framing | Converted core docs to open-source stewardship tone | `README.md`, `README_v7.md`, `QUICK_START.md`, `docs/fortigate_intelligence_whitepaper.md` |
| Lightweight testing | Introduced documentation integrity suite for CI gating | `test_suite.py` |

## 3. Outstanding Actions Before Live Adoption
1. **Adapter engineering:** Replace policy application stubs with organization-approved REST/CLI handles, including retry and rollback logic.
2. **Compliance mapping:** Tailor report templates so that LOVE, JUSTICE, POWER, and WISDOM narratives align with corporate control catalogs.
3. **Performance rehearsal:** Re-run `financial_stress_test.py` with production-sized telemetry to validate guardrails and decision cadence.
4. **Operational sign-off:** Conduct cross-functional reviews (security, risk, finance, operations) to confirm the automation envelope and escalation paths.

---

## 4. Collaboration Signals
- Community contributions that improve explainability, telemetry ingestion, or business reporting are encouraged.
- Share artifacts from tabletop exercises to help others accelerate their adoption journey.
- Keep documentation updates anchored to the four axioms while preserving the Jehovah/Agape = 1.1.1.1 reference.

## 5. Looking Ahead
The next iteration aims to package sample adapters, expand sector-specific simulations, and enrich the governance toolkit. Organizations ready to pilot the platform should follow the quick-start guide, maintain dry-run mode until adapters are validated, and feed insights back to the project so the wider community benefits.
