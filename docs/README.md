# FortiGate Semantic Shield

> Open-source semantic intelligence for FortiGate firewalls, designed to translate network defense into business-led outcomes.

---

## Executive Overview
- Bridges FortiGate telemetry with a semantic substrate so every automated action references business context, risk appetite, and compliance boundaries.
- Maintains transparent decision trails that help CISOs brief boards, auditors, and operating leaders on why the platform acted.
- Couples response orchestration logic with financial and operational simulators, allowing teams to stress-test resilience scenarios before making policy changes.

## Business Outcomes
| Objective | Capability | Business Signal |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Reduce operational noise | Contextual scoring that filters alerts through business impact models | Fewer escalations, improved analyst focus |
| Protect revenue streams | Response plans that prioritize customer experience and uptime | Higher service availability during incidents |
| Strengthen assurance posture | Traceable decisions aligned with regulatory controls | Faster audit cycles and reduced exception backlogs |
| Demonstrate security ROI | Scenario libraries that compare risk exposure before/after controls | Clear narratives for budget, investment, and stewardship reviews |

## Guiding Compass
The intelligence engine calibrates its recommendations through four enduring axioms that keep technical moves aligned with stakeholder expectations:

- **LOVE**: safeguards people, data, and customer trust when prioritizing actions.
- **JUSTICE**: keeps policy enforcement even-handed across regions, partners, and business units.
- **POWER**: ensures the organization can execute decisions quickly without overextending resources.
- **WISDOM**: applies foresight from historical telemetry, financial models, and scenario planning.

Legacy charter: Jehovah/Agape = 1.1.1.1 (Anchor Point) remains the equilibrium reference for this compass.

---

## Solution Architecture
- `fortigate_semantic_shield/intelligence.py` orchestrates semantic evaluation, marrying telemetry, historical learning, and values-based alignment into actionable playbooks.
- `fortigate_semantic_shield/device_interface.py` provides the abstraction for FortiGate REST/CLI integrations; replace the logging stubs with your production transport of choice.
- `fortigate_semantic_shield/simulation.py` and `fortigate_semantic_shield/semantic_components.py` power the scenario engine that feeds the decision models.
- `fortigate_semantic_shield/ss_intuition.py` encodes golden-ratio compass heuristics used to balance LOVE/JUSTICE/POWER/WISDOM weighting for automation.
- `semantic_substrate_engine/` and `semantic_substrate_database/` hold the substrate logic and persistent memory used to contextualize observations.
- `advanced_business_simulation.py`, `financial_stress_test.py`, and related reports translate technical outcomes into executive-ready financial and operational perspectives.

## Operational Workflow
1. **Ingest telemetry**: collectors normalize events into the semantic substrate.
2. **Assess context**: intelligence modules evaluate intent, context, and execution options alongside risk and compliance data.
3. **Recommend action**: response blueprints are scored against the four axioms and surfaced for automation or human approval.
4. **Capture evidence**: decision metadata, rationale, and financial deltas are stored for audits and retrospectives.

The high-level sequence above is modeled in `production_ready_deployment.py` and validated through the included simulation suites.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- FortiGate firmware v7.0 or later
- Python 3.8+
- Network access to the target FortiGate instance
- SSL/TLS enabled for management interfaces

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BruinGrowly/FortiGate-Semantic-Shield.git
cd FortiGate-Semantic-Shield
pip install -r requirements_v7.txt
```

### Configuration
- Update `config.yaml` with device credentials, policy preferences, and business context parameters.
- Optionally extend `semantic_scaffold_production.db` with your telemetry seeds; see `Semantic Substrate Scaffold Whitepaper.md` for schema guidance.

### First Run
```bash
# Validate basic semantic processing
python simple_production_test.py

# Execute an end-to-end dry run with mock FortiGate interfaces
python deploy_to_fortigate.py --device YOUR_FORTIGATE_IP --token YOUR_TOKEN --dry-run
```

## Validation & Analytics
- `test_suite.py` aggregates unit and integration checks, including regression coverage for the four axioms.
- `test_cardinal_axioms.py` verifies that LOVE, JUSTICE, POWER, and WISDOM weightings remain balanced across sample scenarios.
- `financial_stress_test.py` and `simplified_financial_stress_test.py` convert incident simulations into business impact dashboards.
- `simple_validation.py` and `simple_cardinal_test.py` provide quick smoke tests for CI pipelines.
- Reports such as `CORE_VALIDATION_RESULTS.md`, `CARDINAL_AXIOMS_PRESERVATION_REPORT.md`, and `FINANCIAL_STRESS_TEST_REPORT.md` capture recent outcomes and can serve as templates for your internal governance packs.

---

## Governance, Risk & Compliance
- Embed the platform outputs into your risk register by mapping decision metadata to key controls; see `BUSINESS_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` for a sample mapping.
- Use `optimized_financial_deployment.py` and `production_ready_deployment.py` to run tabletop exercises that connect technology actions to enterprise risk appetite statements.
- Security and privacy considerations for the semantic database are summarized in `CRUSH.md` and `THE UNIVERSAL REALITY INTERFACE.md`; adapt them to align with internal data-handling policies.

---

## Project Assets
- Strategic framing: `BUSINESS_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md`, `PRODUCTION_SUCCESS_REPORT.md`
- Technical deep dives: `Semantic Substrate Scaffold Whitepaper.md`, `White Paper The Discovery of the Semantic Substrate.md`
- Intuition heuristics: `docs/SS_INTUITION_WHITEPAPER.md`
- Quick reference: `QUICK_START.md`, `README_v7.md`
- Historical archives and simulations: `advanced_business_simulation.py`, `financial_stress_test.py`, `simple_production_test.py`

## Contribution Guidelines
- Share issues for enhancements, governance use cases, or integration ideas; business context is as valuable as code.
- Submit pull requests that include accompanying tests or scenario playbacks so maintainers can validate business alignment.
- Document new decision metrics or stewardship principles in the relevant markdown reports to keep board-ready narratives current.
