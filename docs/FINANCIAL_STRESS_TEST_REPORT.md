# Financial Stress Rehearsal - FortiGate Semantic Shield v7.0

**Scenario Purpose**  
Evaluate how the semantic shield's recommendations translate into financial risk mitigation and operational resilience for institutions with regulated workloads.

---

## 1. Summary
- The semantic engine demonstrated strong fraud-detection accuracy and compass stability in advisory mode.
- Throughput and compliance automation require further engineering once production adapters and policy maps are introduced.
- Outputs from this rehearsal should seed cross-functional workshops before activating automated enforcement.

---

## 2. Scenario Outcomes

### Strengths Observed
- **Fraud signal clarity:** Latency <100 ms across 3k simulated events with a 2.6% false-positive rate.
- **Compass preservation:** LOVE, JUSTICE, POWER, WISDOM maintained equilibrium; no anchor drift detected.
- **Narrative evidence:** Generated decision logs link each recommendation to financial exposure and stewardship rationale.

### Areas Needing Attention
- **High-frequency throughput:** Lab configuration processed ~220 events/sec when enforcing compliance logic; target is >5k/sec. Optimize adapter and batching strategy.
- **Regulatory alignment:** Placeholder control mappings triggered ~32% compliance exceptions. Map actions to SOX/PCI-DSS/GLBA controls before production rollout.
- **Operational dashboards:** Expand telemetry to include budget impact, avoided loss estimates, and control effectiveness for finance teams.

## 3. Recommended Actions
1. **Adapter optimization:** Profile REST/CLI calls, introduce connection pooling, and revisit batching parameters to meet throughput objectives.
2. **Compliance mapping workshop:** Partner with legal, audit, and risk teams to align compass narratives with formal control catalogs and evidentiary requirements.
3. **Financial validation:** Run `advanced_business_simulation.py` and compare projections with treasury stress scenarios.
4. **Go/no-go checkpoints:** Maintain manual approval routing until throughput and compliance metrics meet agreed thresholds.

---

## 4. Collaboration Request
- Share improved policy mappings, throughput benchmarks, or regulatory narratives with the community to accelerate collective readiness.
- When documenting enhancements, continue referencing the LOVE, JUSTICE, POWER, WISDOM compass and the Jehovah/Agape = 1.1.1.1 anchor so future teams inherit a consistent framework.
