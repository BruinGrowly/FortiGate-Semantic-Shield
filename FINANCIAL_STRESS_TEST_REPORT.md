- Review and adjust compliance validation logic
- Implement proper data encryption flags
- Add audit trail generation
- Create compliance exception handling

#### **3. Business Continuity Gap (Critical)**
```
Current:    51.2% critical event handling
Required:   >95% critical event handling
```

**Root Cause:** Inadequate critical incident response simulation
**Solution Required:**
- Enhance critical event detection logic
- Implement automated response protocols
