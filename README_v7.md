# FortiGate Semantic Shield v7.0 Technical Overview

This document captures the v7.0 capabilities of FortiGate Semantic Shield with an emphasis on enterprise decision support and transparent business alignment.

---

## Purpose and Scope
- Translate FortiGate telemetry into contextual recommendations that reflect business priorities, risk tolerance, and stewardship mandates.
- Maintain a shared language for security, risk, finance, and operations teams when reviewing automated actions and learning outcomes.
- Provide contributors with a technical map for extending or validating the open-source intelligence stack.

---

## Key Enhancements Introduced in v7.0

### Semantic Intelligence Expansion
- Expanded intent/context/execution (ICE) modeling with higher-resolution semantic embeddings.
- Adaptive learning routines that factor historic incident outcomes and stakeholder feedback.
- Scenario clustering that surfaces comparable past events for rapid decision grounding.

### Business Operations Alignment
- Impact modeling that quantifies service availability, customer experience, and cost exposure.
- Automated control mapping that links enforcement steps to regulatory and policy references.
- Executive briefing exports that document rationale, metrics, and residual risks.

### Platform Performance
- Asynchronous data pipelines with configurable concurrency limits.
- Tiered caching for frequently referenced semantic entities and policy responses.
- Observability hooks for latency, queue depth, and recommendation cycle times.

## Architectural Snapshot
- `fortigate_semantic_shield/intelligence.py`: central orchestration for semantic assessment, device signals, and heritage alignment logic.
- `fortigate_semantic_shield/device_interface.py`: FortiGate abstraction layer; swap logging stubs for REST or CLI integrations in production.
- `fortigate_semantic_shield/simulation.py`: simulation harness used for scenario rehearsal and regression validation.
- `fortigate_semantic_shield/ss_intuition.py`: golden-ratio heuristics that translate compass priorities into workload tuning signals.
- `semantic_substrate_engine/`: processing primitives that interpret observations into structured meaning.
- `semantic_substrate_database/`: persistence tier for longitudinal learning and attribution.
- `advanced_business_simulation.py` and `financial_stress_test.py`: bridge technical results with operational and financial dashboards.

---

## Operating Compass
Recommendations are calibrated against four enduring axioms to uphold balanced decision making:

- **LOVE**: prioritizes personal data stewardship, customer trust, and workforce safety.
- **JUSTICE**: keeps enforcement impartial across geographies, partners, and business units.
- **POWER**: confirms the organization can execute and sustain recommended actions.
- **WISDOM**: leverages pattern recognition, telemetry history, and forward-looking simulations.

Legacy charter: Jehovah/Agape = 1.1.1.1 (Anchor Point) remains the equilibrium reference for this compass.

## Installation Reference
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BruinGrowly/FortiGate-Semantic-Shield.git
cd FortiGate-Semantic-Shield
pip install -r requirements_v7.txt
```

Configure `config.yaml` with FortiGate connection details, business context parameters, and any custom policy guardrails. For a dry run without device writes:

```bash
python deploy_to_fortigate.py --device YOUR_FGT --token YOUR_TOKEN --dry-run
```

---

## Validation Playbooks
- `test_suite.py`: umbrella test runner (ensure the script begins with a valid docstring before executing).
- `test_cardinal_axioms.py`: confirms LOVE, JUSTICE, POWER, and WISDOM remain balanced under representative workloads.
- `simple_production_test.py`: smoke test for semantic ingestion and response recommendations.
- `simple_cardinal_test.py`: fast feedback on compass weighting after configuration or code changes.
- `financial_stress_test.py`: models financial exposure and mitigation value across stress scenarios.

---

## Monitoring and Reporting
- `final_validation_success.py` and `CORE_VALIDATION_RESULTS.md`: capture canonical validation runs.
- `CARDINAL_AXIOMS_PRESERVATION_REPORT.md`: documents compass adherence for audit or board reviews.
- `BUSINESS_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` and `PRODUCTION_SUCCESS_REPORT.md`: templates for executive-level readouts.
- Integrate metrics exporters from `advanced_business_simulation.py` with your preferred observability stack to surface latency, adoption rate, and outcome metrics.

---

## Forward Focus
Community backlog themes include:
- Multi-device coordination for distributed FortiGate fleets.
- Deeper telemetry adapters (OT, IoT, and cloud edge signals).
- Enhanced explainability views that map each recommendation to business controls and data lineage.
- Policy-as-code extensions that allow governance teams to version stewardship guardrails alongside playbooks.

Contributions toward these areas—documentation, tests, or code—are welcome via pull requests or issue discussions.

---

## Participation Guidelines
- Submit issues with contextual detail: business objective, telemetry slices, expected vs. observed behavior.
- Include regression tests or scenario replays when altering intelligence or compass weighting logic.
- Document new metrics or stewardship interpretations in the relevant markdown reports so downstream teams can track evolution.
